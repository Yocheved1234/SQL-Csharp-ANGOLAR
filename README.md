Fulstack project.
This project contains 3 languages:
1. SQL - which contains the database and all the relationships.
2. C# - which contains the server side, and is divided by a three-tier project with interfaces, injections and dependency separation.
3. Angular - which contains the client side with all the display.

This project is a Chinese sales website - meaning there are many products that are up for a raffle, each one will be raffled on a different date, and as long as the product has not been raffled, the customer can order a ticket and enter the raffle.

Each part in itself is built in a safe, clear and correct way, although there is always room for improvement.

I hope you win the Chinese lottery.
